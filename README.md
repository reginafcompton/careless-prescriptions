# Careless Prescriptions

[A website](http://carelessprescriptions.com/) that explores and confronts the overprescribing of anti-psychotic drugs and the risks of drug treatment in mental health care. 

Organized by Glenn and Mary Compton, leaders of Manasota-88, a public-health and environmental organization in southwest Florida.

```bash
$ git clone [url to your fork]
$ cd careless-prescriptions
$ gem install jekyll
$ jekyll serve -w
```
