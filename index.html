                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Millions of Americans take psychiatric drugs. Doctors prescribe them, drug companies push them, and patients demand them. Not short of an epidemic, the use of anti-psychotic medication permeates the veins of American culture.</p>
                <p>"Rethink Drugs" explores and confronts the overprescribing of anti-psychotic drugs and the risks of drug treatment in mental health care. On this site, you can find news stories, helpful links, and information about our recent event with author Robert Whitaker, "Careless Prescriptions: Rethinking Our Use of Psychiatric Drugs."</p>

                <h2>Events</h2>
                <p>On April 29, 2017, environmental advocacy group Manasota-88 hosted Robert Whitaker at the Selby Library in Sarasota, Florida. A journalist and the author of five books, Robert Whitaker met with an intimate, but energetic group to challenge the presumed benefits and long-term effects of psychiatric drugs.</p>
                <p>His talk traced the history of psychiatric care in America, beginning with the 1980 publication of DSM-III, a diagnostic manual, which outlined psychiatric illnesses with the implication that drugs could cure them. The manual helped to legitimize the field of psychiatry and, consequently, invited the pharmaceutical industry to pour money into curing brain illnesses with objective precision. Resultantly, pharmaceutical companies marketed with astounding success the mythology of "chemical imbalances," despite discoveries (from as early as the 1980s) found in trial research disproving such assumptions.</p>
